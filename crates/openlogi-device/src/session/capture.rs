//! The channel lifecycle every capture session shares.
//!
//! A capture session arms a device-specific set of controls and then does the
//! same thing whatever those controls are: publish its channel for hardware
//! writes to reuse, listen for diverted reports, re-arm when the device
//! reconnects, stop when asked or when inventory replaces the channel, and
//! hand every control back before it stops listening. [`run_capture`] is that
//! sequence. [`ArmedCapture`] is what differs between the gesture and the
//! keyboard session: which controls are armed and what their reports mean.
